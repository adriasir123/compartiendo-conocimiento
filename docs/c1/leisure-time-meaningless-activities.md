title:  "Essay: Most people fill their leisure time with meaningless activities. Do you agree? "

Indeed, I agree with the statement that nowadays a lot of people fill their leisure time with activities that will lead them to nowhere.

One of the main reasons why we as humans do activities, is because we need to feel useful doing something and we need to get a reward from doing it. This reward is the satisfaction of having achieved something, and this satisfaction will lead us to feel happy, which is our main reason for staying alive.

That's right, we live for improving and being happy.

So with that being said, I think that it's understandable what is happening nowadays, because we have a lot of to do in the Internet to get distracted with. Yes, I am referring to social media websites, apps, video games and so on.

This little things will give us continuous little bursts of satisfaction, and this is the main reason why average people currently surf the internet and play online games, and in the future they'll keep doing it.

You could say that just like the criminal and drug underworld, it also exists a virtual one in the Internet, where simply, all is different than in real life, and a lot of people live inside bubbles. Actually there's a term in japanese, "hikikomori", which refers to people who live inside these bubbles, just playing games, watching anime, and having no social interactions.

As a conclusion, I have to say that the Internet is an important double-edged sword. If you get carried along by it for too much time, it can be bad for you. Most of the things we can do will make us feel satisfied, but they won't give us any real benefits in the long term.

For all these reasons, it's in our hands how we use the Internet.
