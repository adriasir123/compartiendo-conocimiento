# Rotterdam City Center

Would you be able to recover after a complete destruction of your city? Well, I am going to write about Rotterdam, the city that was renovated after the German bombardment. Instead of just moving to another place, the people took this as an opportunity to become a better version of what they were.

Firstly, I will write about Het Park. This place is usually tranquil, despite being set in the centre of Rotterdam. Of course you can find people in there, but Dutch people tend to be quiet.  
For me, the best place in the park is the tulip garden, which is very spacious and has magnificent flowers.

Secondly, we are going to easily find the Euromast tower by Het Park. It is made of concrete, and it's in the ranking of 100-200 meters tall towers worldwide. If we get to the top, we are able to see the most part of the city centre. No need to say that the views on the top are quite picturesque.

Thirdly, just by walking a few minutes we can get to the Maastunnel. It was constructed in 1942, and its main function is to connect the banks of the Nieuwe Maas river, which is one of the most important rivers in Rotterdam.

To sump up, I'd say for sure that Rotterdam is a great city for visiting. In addition, if you are a city dweller, you are going to fall in love with it because it's all about industries and technology.  
And if you want to get even more out of this city, you should learn its history, full of twists and turns.
