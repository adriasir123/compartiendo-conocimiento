# Richard Phillips (born in Michigan)

* Former autoworker

* He was 27 years old when he was imprisoned for a fatal shooting in Detroit in 1971 

* He spent 45 years behind bars for a crime he didn’t commit

* He was sentenced to life without parole

* Longest wrongfully convicted person has ever served in America

* He is now 73  




# Life in prison

* Phillips maintained his innocence during more than four decades in prison

* Philips quote: “I would rather die in prison than to admit to something that I didn’t do"

* Philips painted pictures, and then sold them In order to support himself as he waited for officials to determine his restitution




# About money 

In Michigan, exonerees can receive $50,000/year spent in prison — meaning Phillips stood to collect more than $2 million.

BUT He is only received 30 years’ worth of restitution ($1.5 million payout) because he was serving a concurrent sentence for a separate armed robbery conviction.

BUT His lawyers claim he was wrongfully convicted in that case, too, but prosecutors haven’t acquitted him.




# The truth

* University of Michigan’s Innocence Clinic took up his case

* They found that a co-defendant told the parole board in 2010 that Phillips had no role in the slaying

* They declared him the longest-imprisoned innocent man in America

* He was exonerated in 2018

* The case prosecutors now say was “based almost entirely” on false testimony from one witness.



# Conclusion

Law experts say that:
>“Re-entering society is profoundly difficult for wrongfully convicted individuals, so we have an obligation to provide compassionate compensation to these men for the harm they suffered”
